# Forest Fire

The forest will slowly burn over time. The goal of this experience is to escape the burning forest. The player can use the arrow on their VR wrist to find the flare which is randomly spawned. Once the player finds the flare they can trigger it which will signal a helicopter to the players location, the helicopter will drop a rope when it arrives. 

To finally escape the forest the player can grab the rope and press trigger to be lifted to safety.
